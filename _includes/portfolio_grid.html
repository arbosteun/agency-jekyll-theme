                    <h3>#TrumpIpsum When other websites give you text, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending words that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I assume, are good words. You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text. You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text. We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them. I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s Southern border, and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words. Trump Ipsum is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslim text entering your website. I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable.</h3>
